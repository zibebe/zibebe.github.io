n this course, I will guide you through the essentials of low-level programming, starting with the fundamentals of C programming. This foundation will be crucial for understanding the more advanced topics that follow. While some basic programming knowledge is helpful, this course is designed to be accessible to those with a beginner to intermediate skill level.

# Environment Setup

## Compiler

To get started with this course, you need to set up the necessary tools. The first step is to ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as `gcc`. You can refer to the [official installation manual](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) for detailed instructions, or you can use your operating system's package manager to install it. Here are some quick commands for popular operating systems:

- **Installation (Linux/macOS):**
  ```console
  $ sudo apt-get install gcc  # Debian/Ubuntu
  $ sudo dnf install gcc      # Fedora
  $ brew install gcc          # macOS
  ```
- **Installation (Windows):**
  You can install MinGW, which includes `gcc`. Follow the instructions on the [MinGW website](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download).

## Text Editor

While the choice of editor or integrated development environment (IDE) is largely a matter of personal preference, I recommend using a terminal-based editor for this course. This is because we will be working extensively in the terminal. I absolutely recommend getting started with `Vim` as a terminal editor:

- **Installation (Linux/macOS)**
    ```console
    $ sudo apt-get install vim  # Debian/Ubuntu
    $ sudo dnf install vim      # Fedora
    $ brew install vim          # macOS
    ```
- **Installation (Windows):**
  Follow the instructions on the [Vim website](https://www.vim.org/download.php).

Anyhow, choose the tool that you are most comfortable with, and you'll be well-prepared to follow along with the course.

## Test the Setup

To ensure your environment is set up correctly, we will create a simple "Hello World" program. Follow these steps:

1. **Create the `hello_world.c` file:**

   Open your chosen editor or IDE and create a new file named `hello_world.c`. Add the following content to the file:

   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main(int argc, char **argv) {
       printf("Hello World!\n");
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Compile the Program:**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_world.c`. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```console
   $ gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
   ```

   This command compiles `hello_world.c` and creates an executable file named `hello_world`.

3. **Run the Program:**

   Execute the compiled binary by running:

   ```console
   $ ./hello_world
   ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following output:

   ```console
   Hello World!
   ```

If you encounter any issues, double-check that your compiler and editor are installed correctly and that you are in the correct directory when running the commands.

# Memory Management

Understanding memory management is crucial for effective low-level programming, as it directly impacts the performance, reliability, and efficiency of your code. Here is a short comparison between `Static`, `Stack`, and `Heap`:

## Static
- **Lifetime**: Variables are allocated at compile time and exist for the entire duration of the program. They are not created or destroyed during runtime.
- **Size**: The size is fixed and determined at compile time.
- **Speed**: Accessing static variables is relatively fast because they have a fixed memory location.
- **Usage**: Ideal for global variables, static local variables, and constants that need to retain their value across function calls and throughout the program's execution.

## Stack
- **Lifetime:** Variables are allocated on the stack with a known, fixed lifetime (usually tied to function scope).
- **Size:** The memory is managed automatically; variables go out of scope when their containing block ends.
- **Speed:** Accessing variables stored in the stack is faster because they have contiguous memory and direct access.
- **Usage:** Ideal for local variables and function call parameters. Each function has its own stack frame.

## Heap
- **Lifetime:** Memory allocated on the heap can persist beyond the lifetime of a single function (until explicitly deallocated).
- **Size:** The size is flexible; it can grow or shrink dynamically during program execution.
- **Speed:** Accessing variables stored in the heap is slower because there's no direct access and more indirection through pointers.
- **Usage:** Ideal for dynamic memory allocation, such as when allocating large structures that need to persist across function calls.

In summary:

- `Static` provides persistent storage that exists for the entire duration of the program.
- `Stack` provides fast but temporary storage, ideal for local variables and function parameters.
- `Heap` offers slower but flexible and persistent storage, suitable for dynamic memory allocation and large data structures.
